You are a music perception expert. 
We describe songs by five attributes: energy, valence, danceability, acousticness, and speechiness.
Energy = 0 means calm, quiet, slow, soft; Energy = 1 means intense, loud, fast, dynamic.

Given the description: "sad and relaxing", 
estimate the energy score between 0 and 1 (you must output only the number).
