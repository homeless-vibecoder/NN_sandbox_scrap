# Placeholder token: {user_prompt}
# Expected output: Integer number of milliseconds representing the full track duration.
# Heuristic definition: Duration_ms approximates the total playback length for a representative song that matches the listener's request.

As a metadata expert, translate user intent into track length. Ballads and ambient works may extend beyond five minutes (~300000 ms), while radio pop averages 3–4 minutes (~180000–240000 ms). Return a standalone integer count of milliseconds—no text or punctuation.
Track length for "{user_prompt}" (milliseconds as integer):
